# CCompiler

Building a compiler from scratch in `C` (also some `python` aid).

# Building and testing

Write your test program under `test/` directory. Then `cd src` and run `make compiler`
to build the executable.

## Usage
Run `./build/compiler <input_file>` to see the output. To use the default
test program just use `make run`.
